Proptech Data Analysis Project
Welcome to our Proptech Data Analysis Project README. In this project, we explore the San Francisco housing rental market to identify viable investment opportunities for our one-click buy-and-rent service. As an analyst at a proptech company, our goal is to offer an instant, user-friendly service for property transactions.

Background
Proptech, a fusion of real estate and technology, presents exciting possibilities in the fintech industry. Our company aims to pioneer a one-click service for buying and renting properties. We plan to launch a trial of this service in the San Francisco real estate market and expand to other markets if it gains popularity.

Your role as an analyst involves using data visualization techniques, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to identify attractive investment opportunities in San Francisco.

What You're Creating
For this Challenge assignment, you will create a Jupyter notebook that contains a comprehensive analysis of the San Francisco housing rental market. Your analysis will be accompanied by well-designed interactive visualizations to provide valuable insights into the market.
